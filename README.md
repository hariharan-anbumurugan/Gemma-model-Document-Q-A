Gemma Model Document Q&A with Streamlit

This project demonstrates a powerful document question-and-answer (Q&A) system using state-of-the-art language models and document embeddings. Built with Streamlit, it provides an interactive web interface for users to ask questions about specific documents and receive accurate answers based on the provided content. The system leverages LangChain, Google Generative AI Embeddings, and FAISS for efficient document retrieval and processing.

Features

Document Ingestion and Embedding
Data Loading: The application supports loading documents from a specified directory. In this case, PDF files from the ./us_census directory are loaded.
Text Splitting: Documents are split into manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to ensure efficient processing and accurate embeddings.
Vector Embedding: Google Generative AI Embeddings are used to convert document chunks into vector representations, which are stored in a FAISS vector store for efficient similarity searches.


Question and Answer System
Language Model: The Q&A system uses the ChatGroq model, specifically the "Llama3-8b-8192" variant, to understand and answer user queries.
Prompt Engineering: A carefully designed prompt template ensures that the model provides accurate answers based on the given document context.
Retrieval Chain: A retrieval chain is created using LangChain, which fetches the most relevant document chunks based on the user's question and then generates a response.
Interactive Web Interface

Streamlit Integration: The entire application is built using Streamlit, offering a clean and interactive user interface.
User Inputs: Users can input their questions and trigger the document embedding process through simple text inputs and buttons.
Response Display: The system displays the generated answers along with the relevant document chunks, providing transparency and context to the users.

How It Works
Setup and Load APIs: The application loads the necessary API keys from environment variables and initializes the language model (ChatGroq) and embeddings (GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings).
Document Embedding: When the user clicks the "Documents Embedding" button, the system loads the documents, splits them into chunks, and creates vector embeddings stored in a FAISS vector store.
Question Input: Users can enter their questions related to the documents in the provided text input field.
Answer Generation: Upon receiving a question, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks using the vector embeddings and generates an accurate response using the language model.
Display Results: The answer and the context from which the answer was derived are displayed to the user, with an option to expand and see the detailed document similarity search results.


Future Scope
The project can be extended and improved in various ways:

Support for More Document Formats: Adding support for different document types such as Word, Excel, and plain text files.
Advanced NLP Models: Integrating more sophisticated models like BERT, GPT-4, or custom-trained models for even better accuracy.
Real-Time Analysis: Enabling real-time document analysis and embedding updates.
Enhanced User Interface: Improving the UI with better visualization tools, including charts and graphs for sentiment analysis or topic modeling.
Scalability: Deploying the application on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure to handle larger datasets and more concurrent users.
Multi-Language Support: Extending the application to handle documents and queries in multiple languages.
